# COMP3512 - Winter 2023 - The Project

**Weight**: 30%

**Due:** Mar. 31, 2023 @ 5 PM 

## Overview

This assignment provides an opportunity for you to demonstrate your abilities in PHP and JavaScript.

It is quite a complex piece of work and, if completed successfully, will make a nice addition to your work portfolio.

## Suggested Milestones

This is a large undertaking, so it's important that you work on it continuously throughout the semester. If you attempt to do the majority of work in the last week or two of the semester, you will make your future self's life a living hell **and** probably receive a failing mark. Don't do that.

I've provided a [suggested set of milestones](suggested-milestones.md) for the semester, but they are just that - suggestions. To quote Fleetwood Mac: "You can go your own way."

## Starting Materials

There are a few materials you have been provided for The Project:

### Travel Photos
There is a zip file with travel photos on D2L (under `Content > The Project Materials`). You need to host these photos on Cloudinary, as outlined in the [week 00 checklist on D2L](https://learn.mru.ca/d2l/common/popup/popup.d2l?ou=19338&queryString=&footerMsg=&buttonOffset=0&popBodySrc=/d2l/lms/checklist/viewchecklist.d2l%3Fou%3D19338%26popup%3Dtrue%26checklistId%3D733&width=800&height=600&hasStatusBar=false&hasAutoScroll=true&hasHiddenHeader=false&p=d2l_cntl_95ff58f219f54d1d885d0c186be153bc_1).

#### Restrictions

- You **must** use these photos for The Project. Don't grab some random photos from the web.
- They **must** be hosted on Cloudinary. They do **not** live on your site!
- Do **not** put these photos in your GitHub repo. They don't belong there.

### Starting Repo

Here is the link to the GitHub Classroom Assignment that will create your starting repo for The Project: https://classroom.github.com/a/S9LA_4lU

The repo is mostly a blank slate, with these important exceptions:

#### `.gitignore`
If you don't know what a gitignore file is, do a quick bit of research on them. They're very useful. 

Feel free to add whatever you need to the starting one.

#### `README.md`
Fill this out so that when I go to your repo I can easily tell at a glance whose repo it is.

#### `my-resources.md`
Record the sites, tools, blogs, and other such resources that you find useful as you work on The Project here.

This **will** be part of your marked work.

#### `project-journal.md`
Keeping a developer journal of some kind is a very useful practice. Look at the following posts to get a feel for the topic:
- [I Bet You Don't Keep A Developer Journal](https://dev.to/allthecode/i-bet-you-don-t-keep-a-developer-journal-3-reasons-you-should-4kn3)
- [Coding Career Advice: Keeping a Daily Work Journal](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/09/coding-career-advice-daily-work-journal/)
- [Keep journals to become a better developer](https://dbader.org/blog/keep-journals-to-become-a-better-developer)
- [What to write in your Code Journal](https://dev.to/jacquibo/what-to-write-in-your-code-journal-code-journaling-pt-3-of-4-3h8a)
- [Why Every Developer Should Keep a Daily Code Journal](https://medium.com/developer-purpose/why-every-developer-should-keep-a-daily-code-journal-fb83ab848c6)

Please keep a journal of your experiences working on The Project in this document. You can decide what to record (see the above articles for ideas) and how much to write down.

This **will** be part of your marked work. I don't expect it to be a novel, so don't freak out.
