## Background

You are a junior espionage agent with modest programming and web-design skills working for the Canadian government.

Someone high up the food chain has had the bright idea of creating a fake travel photo site as a way of informing agents in the field about the locations of dead drops in the cities where the agents are stationed.

You have been tasked to build a prototype of the travel site, provided with a few raw materials (travel photos and a database-creation script hacked together by an agent even _more_ junior than you)...and given 82 days to complete the prototype.

Good luck.

## The Requirements Conversation

Here is what your supervisor said to you about The Project:

> _So the bigwigs thought we could send dead drop coordinates to field agents by putting those coordinates into photo information on a web site we control. To a casual observer, they just see a regular old collection of travel photos, right? If they select a photo, they'll see things like the city and country where it was taken, the name of the photographer - stuff like that. And - here's the important part - the latitude and longitude of where the picture was taken and a rating. If the rating is 3 stars, that's a signal to a field agent looking at the site - it means that there is a dead drop at that location._
>
> _For this to work, we need to build a site that looks perfectly normal - nothing suspicious, see? That's where **you** come in. I don't know whose a** you kissed to get this gig, but here we are. You better not screw this up, or it means **both** of our careers._
> 
> _Anyway. We want you to build the site so that it has two main parts: some sort of admin pages, where a handler can log in and see a list of photos that are in the database. They'll likely want to see the photo, the latitude and longitude, and the rating. They want to be able to easily change the rating, naturally. And maybe be able to filter all the pics by city, rating,...stuff like that._

> _You writing this down? Good._
>
> _The other part of the site needs to be where people can look at all the different photos. To make it look normal, it'll need to have all the usual things a site like this would have. Filters, so they can look pics up by country and city. Maybe some information about the country being filtered and the city, too. Some maps would really sell this, so you'll have to put some Google map stuff in there, too._
>
> _You're looking a bit nervous there. Anything wrong? No? I didn't think so._
>
> _You can get all the technical details from Agent JP. That pencil-neck speaks your language. If you have any questions, you talk to him. Not me._
