# Site Use Summary

## Admin Site

The idea here is that a person working for the government needs to log in to a site and change the ratings on photos to/from 3 to indicate to field agents whether the lat/long of those photos is actually a dead drop location or not.

Use your imagination here a bit: if **you** were such a person, how would you like to see the necessary information (thumbnail, country, city, latitude, longitude, and rating) for all the photos in the database displayed? Remember: you're not there to look at the pretty pictures - they don't mean anything to you: they're simply a means to hide a latitude and longitude. Instead, you're there to set the rating of some photo. That's it.

The ability to filter by country, city, and rating is meant to make life easier for these people.

The ability to sort and "remember" the sort order via cookies is an example of a not-really-necessary feature that users often ask of developers: a feature they think would be neat, but will likely not end up being used much, if at all. Welcome to dealing with users. :)

## Public-Facing Site

This site is actually targeted to TWO different users, right?
